**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Yes, the feature request is related to a problem. The problem is that the current movie playback system lacks essential functionality, such as the ability to adjust volume, fast forward or rewind, and enter fullscreen mode. These limitations hinder the user experience and detract from the enjoyment of watching the movie. Therefore, the feature request aims to address these issues by implementing the necessary controls for a seamless and enjoyable viewing experience.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like the movie playback system to include comprehensive functionality that allows users to have full control over their viewing experience. This includes the ability to adjust the volume levels as needed, fast forward or rewind to specific scenes, and enter fullscreen mode for immersive viewing. Additionally, it would be beneficial to have intuitive and user-friendly controls that make it easy to navigate through the movie and customize the playback settings according to individual preferences. Overall, the solution should prioritize enhancing the user experience by providing seamless and flexible movie playback options.
**Describe alternatives you've considered**
One alternative solution would be to use a different movie playback platform or application that offers more comprehensive playback controls. This could involve switching to a different streaming service or using a standalone media player software that allows for greater customization and control over the viewing experience.  Additionally, if the issue is with a specific device or software, another alternative could be to troubleshoot and seek assistance from technical support or forums to address any potential software bugs or compatibility issues that may be causing the limitations in playback functionality.
