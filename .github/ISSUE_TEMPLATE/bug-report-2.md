**Describe the bug**
The bug in question pertains to various aspects of a website's design and functionality, including insufficient engagement text, a poorly designed logo, a lack of distinction in the color scheme, responsiveness issues on mobile devices, and inconvenient placement of page access links. These issues collectively detract from the professionalism and user-friendliness of the website, diminishing its effectiveness in engaging visitors and presenting the product or service effectively.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to 'https://torontocupcake.com/index.html'
2. See error

**Expected behavior**
I expected the website to have engaging and informative text to captivate visitors, a well-designed logo that is easily recognizable and visually appealing, a color scheme that effectively draws attention and enhances readability, responsiveness across all devices for optimal user experience, and strategically placed page access links for easy navigation.
