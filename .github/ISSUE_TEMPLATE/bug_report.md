**Describe the bug**
As I settle in to enjoy the movie, I find myself frustrated by an unexpected predicament: despite hitting play, the volume control remains stubbornly unresponsive, leaving the sound trapped at a fixed level. No matter how many times I try, the volume refuses to budge, rendering the audio stagnant and unalterable. Attempting to fast forward or rewind the movie proves equally fruitless, as the timeline stubbornly resists any attempts at manipulation, keeping me stuck in a static viewing experience. Even my efforts to expand the screen to fullscreen mode are met with resistance, leaving the cinematic landscape confined to its original dimensions. Each interaction with the movie leaves me perplexed and disheartened, as I grapple with the inexplicable limitations imposed upon my viewing enjoyment.
**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to 'https://ww.yesmovies.ag/movie/filter/movies.html'
2. Click on 'any move and play that movie and then you can see that you can not increase the volume , not even you forward the movie and you not also do full screen '
3. See error

**Expected behavior**
I expected to be able to watch the movie with full control over the playback functions, including adjusting the volume, fast forwarding or rewinding as desired, and expanding the screen to fullscreen mode for a more immersive viewing experience.
